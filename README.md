# Custom MangoHUD

Decky plugin to use a custom MangoHUD configuration.

Uses a user systemd path unit to monitor changes to the configuration file and overwrite them with the desired custom configuration using a systemd service unit.

Currently the configuration can be editied at ~/.config/mangohud.conf. The ability to modify it through the GUI may be added later.
